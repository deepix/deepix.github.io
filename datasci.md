### Improving diversity in NYC schools

_Which schools in New York need the most help, to improve diversity in SHSAT exam?_

SHSAT is a competitive exam to enter specialized high schools in NYC.  It is currently overwhelmingly White and Asian.  We check which schools with Black and Latino populations hold potential but need help.

KNN, Random Forests, Logistic Regression, and Perceptron Neural Network.

### Detecting fake news

_Can we detect fake news using machine learning?_

We try both classical techniques as well as recurrent neural networks.  Our best accuracy was 81%.

### Predicting success rate for online ads

_Will this user click on this ad?_

Online advertising is big business.  Ad companies make money only when a user clicks on an ad, so they try hard to show ads on which a user is likely to click.

On a large, anonymized dataset, we run logistic regression.  We get 76% accuracy, AUC 0.58.

### Effect of regulation on Internet access

_Does government regulation improve Internet connectivity?_

We explore whether regulation can lower costs, improve speed, or provide more people with the Internet.
