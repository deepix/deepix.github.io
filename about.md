Hello, my name is Deepak.  I work as a software engineer at Citrix
Systems, Santa Clara.

My technical skills span three broad domains: Unix systems, Web
networking, and big data.  I have extensive working knowledge of C and
Unix.  I also understand Web networking very well, having worked on
[NetScaler](http://www.netscaler.com/) application load balancer at
HTTP and TCP layers.

For the last couple years, I have been building a data and analytics
pipeline.  This has led me to distributed systems and big data
ecosystems.  These days I spend my time working with Ansible, Hadoop,
Spark, Python and Golang.

The name of the blog, _Lead, Kindly Byte_, is a pun on [a poem by John
Newman](http://www.newmanreader.org/works/verses/verse90.html) and my
name, which means 'Light' in Sanskrit.

You can reach me on e-mail: n.deepak at gmail.com
