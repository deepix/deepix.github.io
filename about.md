Hello, my name is Deepak Nagaraj.  I work as a software engineer at
Citrix Systems, Santa Clara.  I'm also a graduate student at UC
Berkeley, in the MIDS (Master of Information and Data Science)
program.  My previous education is in computer science from
Visweswaraya Tech University, India, and Ohio State University.

I grew up in Bangalore, back when it was still a sleepy town.  I have
always been fond of books, computers and abstract
topics.  I'm married to [Chaitra](http://chaitrasuresh.com) and have a
cute little daughter.

My technical skills span three broad domains: Unix systems, Web
networking, and data analytics.  I have extensive working knowledge of
C and Unix.  I also understand Web networking very well, having worked
on [NetScaler](http://www.netscaler.com/) application load balancer at
HTTP and TCP layers.

For the last couple years, I have been building a data analytics
pipeline.  This has led me to data engineering and machine learning.
These days I spend my time working with Spark, R, Python and Scala.

The name of the blog, _Lead, Kindly Byte_, is a pun on
[a poem by John Newman](http://www.newmanreader.org/works/verses/verse90.html)
and my name, which means 'Light' in Sanskrit.
