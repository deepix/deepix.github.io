Hello, I'm Deepak.  I work as a machine learning engineer at Citrix.
On a typical day, I might be writing models, deploying them into
production, enhancing ML infrastructure, or debugging running models.
I use Spark, Python, Scala, sklearn, Hive, YARN and Azure for my daily
work.  I'm passionate about real-time and production-grade ML systems,
which demand that you understand both software engineering and machine
learning.

From 2003 to 2015, I worked in networking companies, where I wrote
software for load balancers to make websites load faster.  It was
low-level stuff: C, Unix, TCP, HTTP, where you were conscious about
CPU cache misses and how many bytes you allocated, and debugging could
mean looking at a corrupted stack in gdb or stepping through assembler
instructions.  This background has given me an appreciation for the
productivity high-level software bring, but I'm still curious about
going a layer below and understanding how they work.

I recently graduated from UC Berkeley in data science (MIDS, 2020).
I also have a master's degree in computer science (Ohio State, 2008)
and a bachelor's degree in computer science (PESIT, Bangalore, 2003).

I don’t have an active lifestyle outside of work.  When I’m not
working, I mostly like to sit back and relax.  I read a lot of
books, play with my daughter, or watch some streaming TV.

The name of the blog, _Lead, Kindly Byte_, is a pun on
[a poem by John Newman](http://www.newmanreader.org/works/verses/verse90.html)
and my name, which means 'Light' in Sanskrit.
